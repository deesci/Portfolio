	June 2020 - 
	Just added Machine Learning kNN project 07

# Portfolio


### About

These are my projects created so far using Python and SQL as main programming languages. The libraries used are NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy. Each of these six projects are in `ipynb` Jupyter notebook format. Further ones will be added as and when they get ready. Next one in progress is on k-nearest neighbor algorithm. 

It would be great to receive email with feedback, suggestions etc.
