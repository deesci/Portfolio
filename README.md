	June 2020 - 	Just added Deep Learning and Random Forest

# Portfolio


### About

These are my projects created so far using *Python* and *SQL* as main programming languages. The libraries used are ***Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy***. Most of these projects are in `ipynb` Jupyter notebook format. 

Further ones will be added as and when they get ready. Next one in progress is on k-nearest neighbor algorithm. 

It would be great to receive email with feedback, suggestions etc.
