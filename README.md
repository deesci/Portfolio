### About

As data science enthusiast, I collect here my projects from research and learning different libraries, algorithm, problems. 

I use *Python* and *SQL* as main programming languages. The libraries used are *Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy*. Most of these projects are in `ipynb` Jupyter notebook format. 

Further works will be added as and when they get ready. 

 
  
 ## Projects   
	

### Machine Learning
